# How to play:
1. There are different clips/checkers on the board

2. Checker has number (level) and color (marks its owner). Each player has own set of checkers and could increase level of one of them in his turn.

4. When checker explodes on other checkers, levels are summarized and new checkers get color (and owner) of exploded one
